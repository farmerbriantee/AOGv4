* 30 % frame speed improvements by reducing multiple OpenGLreadpixel calls
into a single.
* section minimum distance trigger no longer affected by turnOn time.
* very peculiar bug caused the sections to turn on at 26 km/hr. Individual section lookaheads
had no limits set causing overflow
* Program will now do lookahead successfully up to 36 km/hr. Sufficient for agriculture.
* Will map at any speed, sufficient for aircraft speeds.
* various bug fixes as usual


v 2.0 March 2017

* 8 sections now
* auto steer enabled with separate serial
* single section for mapping when all the sections are on
* 
v 1.9 Feb 2017

* 
* readPixel now a single block rather then multiple reads. Faster, more accurate. 
* Workswitch now in settings, selectable on-off and active low or high.
* can set which side area is recorded from
* metric and imperial can be set
* Turn grid on off
* Allow lightbar to be controlled independently of guidance lines 
* Pin marking, selecting, deleting, view in Google Earth

* Common buttons immediate, secondary/protected functions as context.
* multi colour pins, selectable
* Files saved in binary. Significant speed up.
* Able to export files as text.
* Contour file contains UTM and LatLong with elevation for elevation map generation - to come in  viewer.
* most data and status at top of screen
* eliminated NMEA strings off top of Gui, in GPS Data screen now
* Field directories are set up at start of field
* ability to continue a field, every field is its own directory.
* Directories and files are all created if not exist, no matter on initial state of program
*
* Significantly modified the OpenGL SharpGL wrapper, excluded all serialization, scene graph
* added additional overloaded GL and GLU functions for ReadPixel and inverse matrix
* Reduced SharpGL into only 2 DLL's for GL and Winforms.
* Removed 399 error checking calls that internals were commented anyways in every GL call
* 3469 xml documentation warnings still to fix. Volunteers?
* added functions for matrix, texture, vectors directly to OpenGL.cs from scenegraph
* AgOpenGPS SharpGL is completely forked from SharpGL written by David Kerr. License still applies.
* AgOpenGPS will no longer work with Standard SharpGL wrapper and DLL's.

* Auto NMEA frequency determination.
* tramlines settable frequency and start position. Multi coloured.
* Speed compensated lookahead. Based on work of Torriem.
* No longer use of timers, data comes in updates/sec so app must conform, not other way around.
* Completely reworked frame timing. "Fast" loop continuously runs and only once a complete NMEA 
	sentence appears then fix position and draw routine are fired. Based off of 20 Hz watchdog timer
* Each section has its own accumulated acres in its button
* FINALLY runs nicely at 10 hz update 



v1.3.1.1 Dec 1 2016

* TCP server added. Port 7777
* tileable textures for field surface
* WebCam support
* New and close job are now; resume - new - open; in its own dialog

* changed to have each section remeber its own off auto status and the buttons merely changing those
	not having buttons remember their own status


v1.2 October 2016

* Fixed the RMC and GGA parsing routine, rather then reading an NMEA line and then updating, read all existing lines and process all at once. 
	- much faster accumulation of data
* Changed OpenGL draw routine from being triggered when RMC rec'd to 5 frames per second and triggering functions from there.
	- three seperate threads - GPS Serial IO and decoding NMEA stream, sectionRelay serial IO, Draw routine. 
* Ability to save and retrieve fields
* Changed the Section tab to remove clutter with less sections
* added section on and off request in section control. Allows the section to delay turning off and when turned on to remain on for 2 secs minimum.
* Fixed fonts consistency
* Added bottom status bar - looks way better in Linux
* Added Arduino serial port to control sectionRelays
* Output the section on off status to Arduino for full external control of sections
